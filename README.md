# BaseNIO
***

After learning [ApacheMina](http://mina.apache.org/),we provide this java Non-blocking IO (**NIO**) mini framework. Thanks for MINA's so excellent work.

Using this frameï¼Œyou can build a TCP server for accepting TCP client channel connection request, and that , process socket read\write.
